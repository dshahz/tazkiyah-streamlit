> Track habits, mood, and reflections to cultivate intentional living.

---

## ðŸ“– Overview

**Tazkiyah** means purification and growth. This Streamlit application provides a personal dashboard for daily self-reflection and habit tracking, designed to help users live more intentionally and align their actions with their values.

It offers a simple interface to log daily habits (spiritual, physical, mental), track mood, journal reflections, and receive immediate feedback on sentiment and personal alignment. A dedicated progress dashboard helps visualize trends over time.

While inspired by Islamic principles of self-development, the app is designed to be universally applicable for anyone seeking greater self-awareness, discipline, and mindful growth.
